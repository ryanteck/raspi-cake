Test Assessment Report


This was a triumph.
I’m making a note here:
HUGE SUCCESS.
It’s hard to overstate 
my satisfaction.
<<Aperture Ascii Logo>> Aperture Science 
We do what we must
because we can.
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead. <<Toxic Logo>>

<<Aperture>> But there’s no sense crying
over every mistake.
You just keep on trying 
till you run out of cake.
<<Atom> And the Science gets done.
And you make a neat gun.
For the people who are
still alive.

Dear <<Subject Name Here>>,

I’m not even angry.
I’m being so sincere right now.
Even though you <<Heart Logo>>broke my heart.
And killed me.
And <<Explosion Ascii>> tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a <<Fire Ascii>> fire.
As they burned it hurt because
I was so <<Tick Ascii>> happy for you!
Now these points of data
make a beautiful line
And we’re out of beta. 
We’re releasing on time.
So <<<Explosion>>> I’m GLaD. I got burned.
Think of <<Atom Ascii>all the things we learned
<<Aperture>>For the people who are
still alive.

One last thing:

Go ahead and leave me.
I think I prefer to stay inside.
Maybe you’ll find someone else
to help you.
Maybe <<Black Mesa Logo>>Black Mesa…
THAT WAS A JOKE. FAT CHANCE.
Anyway, this <<Cake Ascii> cake is great.
It’s so delicious and moist.
Look at <<GLaDOS ASCII>> me still talking 
When there’s <<Toxic logo>> Science to do.
When <<Aperture>> I look out there,
It makes me Glad I’m not you.
<<Toxic Logo>> I’ve experiments to run.
<<Explosion Logo>>There is research to be done.
<<Aperture>> On the people who are
still alive.
