Test Assessment Report


This was a triumph.
I’m making a note here:
HUGE SUCCESS.
It's hard to overstate 
my satisfaction.
Aperture Science 
We do what we must
because we can.
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.

But there’s no sense crying
over every mistake.
You just keep on trying 
till you run out of cake.
And the Science gets done.
And you make a neat gun.
For the people who are
still alive.

Dear <<Subject Name Here>>,

I’m not even angry.
I’m being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart.
And killed me.
And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you!
Now these points of data
make a beautiful line
And we’re out of beta. 
We’re releasing on time.
So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
Think of all the things we learned
For the people who are
still alive.

One last thing:

Go ahead and leave me.
I think I prefer to stay inside.
Maybe you'll find someone else
to help you.
Maybe Black Mesa,
THAT WAS A JOKE. FAT CHANCE.
Anyway, this cake is great.
It's so delicious and moist.
Look at me still talking 
When there's Science to do.
When I look out there,
It makes me Glad I'm not you.
I've experiments to run.
There is research to be done.
On the people who are
still alive.
